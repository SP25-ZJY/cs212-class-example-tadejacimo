## `‚è∫Ô∏è What does not count as participation? ‚è∫Ô∏è`
- Attendance does not count towards participation.
- Attendance is a **pre-condition** for participation.
- Therefore, if you are not attending or miss many classes, your participation will suffer.

## `January Participation`
<h3>1. How much time do you spend per week studying for this class (not including regular meeting times)?</h3>
- Answer: I try to spend an hour a day studying for this class -- and on days that 
- we do have class, I like to spend that hour revising everything we learned 
- the class before to make sure the information sticks in my head. 

<h3>2. Give at least 3 specific examples of your participation.</h3>
1. I try to answer questions in class
2. I make sure I do the class examples when put in small groups, and sharing with the professor
3. I make sure I do my share of the work in labs and small group work

<h3>3. Goals for March: List at least 2 participation goals for March.</h3>
1. Answer more questions in class 
2. Asking for clarification if I think something is confusing 

<h3>4. Identify a personal value that you want to practice in class: confidence
- What are three ways you can practice the value in class?
  1. Answering questions more often
  2. Sharing thoughts about how to program something more often
  3. Talking to new people instead of just talking to my best friend 

<h3>5. Flexible Attendance Policy:</h3>
- In this class, we don‚Äôt take attendance, and missing classes will not hurt your participation grade. Are you using the flexible attendance policy responsibly? Explain.
- I haven't missed a single class, and I don't intend to skip -- I know if I do 
- start skipping, I won't be able to stop, and that will really hurt my grade. 
- I also want to make sure I'm actually taking time to learn the material 
- rather than cram it all in at the end.
